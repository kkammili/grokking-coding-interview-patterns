/**
 * Problem: Employee Free Time
 * 
 * Statement:
 * You are given a list containing the schedules of multiple employees.
 * Each personâ€™s schedule is a list of non-overlapping intervals sorted in ascending order.
 * An interval is specified with the start and end time.
 * Your task is to find the list of finite intervals representing the free time for all the employees.
 * 
 * Note:
 * - The free time intervals are the common free intervals across all employees.
 * - These free intervals are calculated between the earliest start time and the latest end time of all meetings.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= schedule.length, schedule[i].length <= 50
 * - 0 <= interval.start < interval.end <= 10^8
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: schedule = [[[1, 2], [5, 6]], [[1, 3]], [[4, 10]]]
 * Output: [[3, 4]]
 * Explanation: The free time interval common to all employees is [3, 4].
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: schedule = [[[1, 3], [6, 7]], [[2, 4]], [[2, 5], [9, 12]]]
 * Output: [[5, 6], [7, 9]]
 * Explanation: The free time intervals are [5, 6] and [7, 9].
 * 
 * Approach:
 * - Flatten all employee schedules into one list of intervals.
 * - Sort all intervals by their start time.
 * - Merge overlapping intervals to get a single timeline.
 * - Identify gaps between the merged intervals to find the free time.

console.log(employeeFreeTime([[[1, 2], [5, 6]], [[1, 3]], [[4, 10]]]));  // Output: [[3, 4]]
